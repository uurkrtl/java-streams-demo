## Coding: Java Streams

Create a new project in IntelliJ and implement the following steps using Java Streams.

-   Step 1: Filter a list of numbers and only output the even numbers.
-   Step 2: Use 'map' and double each number in the list.
-   Step 3: Sort the list in ascending order.
-   Step 4: Perform a 'reduce' operation to calculate the sum of all numbers in the list.
-   Step 5: Use 'forEach' and output each processed number.
-   Step 6: Collect the processed numbers into a new list using 'collect'.
